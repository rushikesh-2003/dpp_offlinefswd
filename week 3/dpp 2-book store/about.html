        An online bookstore is a digital platform that allows users to browse, search, and purchase books over the internet. Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar bookstores, an online bookstore provides the convenience of shopping for books from anywhere with an internet connection, offering a wide range of titles across different genres.</p>
